## What is cloud computing? 
Cloud computing is the service which provide compute service, storage service which allow you to pay for the services used where PC is in the datacenter not in local. 
Compute source means Ram needed by the computer. 
Storage data need to be stored in the resources
## What is shared responsibility model?
Shared responsibility model: Is the concept where responsibilities of maintaining a data center is shared by between two parties. In case of cloud computing, it is shared between the cloud provider and service users. 
Infrastructure as a service IaaS, Platform as a Service PaaS, SaaS Software as a Service: 
The responsibility always retained by customer are:  information stored in cloud, devices that are allowed to connect to your cloud, account identities of the people, service and device with in an organization. 
Cloud provider always provide for: Physical data center, physical network, physical host.
Your service will determine the responsibility of things like: Operating system, Network Controls, Applications, Identity and Infrastructure. 
## What are the cloud models?
Define the deployment type of cloud resources: 
Private cloud:  Private cloud is the cloud service provided to the organization or party. It is focus on serving a particular organization eg. Dell EMC cloud for Microsoft azure stack. Company needing a seamless hybrid cloud experience with integration between on-premise and Azure public cloud environment. Hardware should be purchase 
Public cloud: Public cloud is the cloud service provided to user through internet. It is provided to multiple users and organizations. Eg. Alibaba cloud, amazon cloud, Microsoft cloud, google cloud platform, IBM cloud, Oracle cloud. No need for hardware purchase 
Hybrid cloud: Cloud computing that uses both public and private cloud in an inter-connected environment. A hybrid cloud environment can be used to allow a private cloud to surge for increased, temporary demand by deploying public cloud resources. Hybrid cloud can be used to provide an extra layer of security.                                             
Multi cloud platform:  Deal with more than one cloud provider. Scenario is that shifting into different cloud provider. Regardless, in a multi-cloud environment you deal with two or more public cloud providers and manage resources and security in both environments.  
Azure Arc: Azure arc is a set of technologies that helps manage your cloud environment.   
Public cloud:	No Capex, pay as you go, no hardware maintenance
No Deep technical skills required	Security& compliance 
Ownership, Specific Scenarios with unique                  
Private cloud:	CapEx is required, Run legacy app in private cloud, Utilize existing infrastructure, meet any security requirements 	Can be more expensive
Complicate to manage 
Its skill & expertise are mandatory 
Hybrid cloud: 	Hybrid cloud is a cloud deployment service where you can use both public cloud and private cloud services. Both services can be interconnected with each other.  	Need it expertise to handle services 
Complicated to manage 
Can be more expensive
